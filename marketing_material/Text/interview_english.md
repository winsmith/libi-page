Hi Daniel! So, what is libdo exactly?

Nice to see you! Depending on who you ask, libido is can mean your body's feeling of desire, or it can be a broader umbrella term for both the corporeal and spiritual feeling of sexuality. What exactly that means for yourself is up to you to decide, because I think this is different for each individual. 

And why should people track their libido?

I wrote my App, Libi, to get an overview of my mood and libido over time. Recording it at random intervals throughout the day allows me to find influences and long term trends. I can use it to show graphs of how my libido and mood develop and compare them to other stuff like calories burnt on activity, or sleep.

Libi can optionally also track menstruation, sexual activity, orgasms, and (soon) your energy level — awesome for spoonies. I think it helps me be more aware of how I feel if I try to objectively evaluate where my body and mind are on a given day. Has my mood been below average for weeks now? Maybe I can change something about my situation. Is my libido different than usual? Maybe I can recognize an overarching cycle.

Are there other libido trackers on the market? What makes your app special?

Many apps for tracking and calculating menstrual cycles (like Clue or Flo) also allow you to enter your libido. There are also various mood tracking apps. However, I am not aware of an app that combines them in this fashion, especially with an eye towards an analytical approach that shows you statistics and correlations. Libi is the how-am-I-today-actually?-app that allows you to see tiny differences and trends in your data. And if you already use an app to track your menstrual flow, you can exchange data with it using the Apple Health app and use Libi's features without entering this stuff more than once.

That's very sensitive data that you're collecting. 
How do you take care of your users' privacy?

I'm a privacy nut in general, and even more so when there's such intimate data. No data that you enter into Libi ever leaves your phone. Data points are saved into a local database and that's where they stay. There's no server involved. If you allow it, Libi will sync data with Apple Health, where you also have full control over it.

Where can you download the app?

Libi is available for free in the [iOS App Store: Libi](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/libi/id1475819970)

Will Libi be released for Android?

I hear that question a lot. Personally I think I lack the skills to create a good Android version, and you don't have the Apple Health ecosystem there. Maybe I'll find a way to make it happen with someone, but right now I don't have specific plans.
