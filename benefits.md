# Libi — your personal libido and mood tracker

Keywords: libido, mood, reproductive, sex, 

## Track your libido, mood, and sexual activity
Be more aware of how your body works, and how stress, workouts, and other factors influence your libidinal cycle. Find out short- and long-term trends and improve your mental health and/as well as your awareness of your needs and wants. 

Once you know what you want and need, you can also communicate this information better to your partner(s).

## Track your Menstrual Cycle
If you menstruate, you can also quickly and easily enter menstrual flow, learn more about your cycle’s influence on your life, and use Apple Health algorithms to analyze and predict your menstruation.

## Find Connections
Once you’ve started tracking your mood, libido, sexual activity and menstrual flow, you will discover beautiful charts that can give you a quick and glanceable idea of how you’re doing, where you’re going and historical trends.

You can also combine Libi’s graphs with data from the Health app and find correlations with eating, workouts, caffeine intake, and more. This way you can find out what influences your libidinal cycle and mood, and vice versa!

(Currently the app only offers Apple Watch workouts for correlation, but there’s more to come. Don’t hesitate to contact me with requests)

## Quick and easy entry
Entering data is just one swipe in Libi’s attractive and streamlined user interface (which supports Dark Mode of course). If you want, the app can send you experience sampling notifications at different times each day, giving you a comprehensive overview over your typical day.

## Your Data is Secure
Libi takes great care of your data. There are no accounts and no custom syncing, just iCloud and Apple Health. Your data stays on your devices!

However, you can export your data in JSON format whenever you want. This way you can back up and transfer your data analyze it yourself, or even take it elsewhere.

## Sync with Health App
Libi will read and write all compatible data types directly from and into the Apple Health App on your phone using HealthKit. This means this data syncs with your other devices, and it is saved in a secure, encrypted way. 

It also means that you can allow other apps to share this data, for example the built-in Menstruation algorithms in iOS 13, or cycle tracking apps like Clue or Flow. If you use a HealthKit compatible app, you don’t have to enter the same data twice— it will simply show up in Libi. 

## Customize Libi to Fit Your Needs 
Some people will use Libi to mainly enter their libido, others to manage their mood or cycle. Since Libi allows you to rearrange the order in which you enter things, it can keep up with what’s important to you! You can even hide data point types you never want to enter. This way, data entry goes even quicker!

## Ad supported, but you can remove them 
Libi is free for everyone, using small ad banners that should bring in a trickle of revenue to continue supporting and developing the app. If you don’t like ads (I mean, who does?) and would like to support me directly, there’s also a yearly subscription for the price of a small coffee. <3
