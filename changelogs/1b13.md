Hi Everyone, thanks for testing Libi!

This release has Ads! I don't know if they work yet, because Google Admob is super ultra meh. I'm not a huge fan, but I gotta make some cash out of this baby.

You can disable the ads by going to Settings > Ad Settings > Disable Ads by Paying. Don't worry, you won't have to pay.
